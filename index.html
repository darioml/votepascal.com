          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Vote Pascal <span class="text-muted">for DPE</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Hi there, I'm a third year Electrical and Electronic Engineering and I have previously been involved with the Union as a year rep. My effort were recognised with the John Lever Memorial Award for contributing significantly to teaching and learning achievements. I have also been web editor for RAG and I am currently EESoc's treasurer. And now I am ready to be your DPE.</p>
          <p class="lead">What do I do as DPE? DPE stands for 'Deputy President of Education' and as such I overview all the year and dep reps and attend meetings with the staff here at Imperial College, ensuring that you get the best academic experience possible. Aside from this, I also want to implement the changes below.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-pull-4 col-sm-8 col-sm-pull-4">
          <h2 class="featurette-heading">eLearning. <span class="text-muted">Access resources from anywhere</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">I want to take elearning to the next level. Lectures are being recorded now, but the quality is low and only a few lectures participate. Many lecturers are reluctant of participating in recording, fearing a drop in attendance or tedious setup requirements. This can be easily solved by conducting case studies and asking year reps to set up the recordings in advance of the lecture.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-8">
          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Feedback. <span class="text-muted">Listening to Opinions</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">The academic feedback needs to improve. Many students are still receiving inadequate feedback for their coursework and lecturers often dismiss year reps' opinions. I will change this by improving the communication between the student reps and staff, for example by expanding the current rep-staff conference. </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Representation. <span class="text-muted">For all Students.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Provide more support for postgraduate students and integrate the representation system for PG within the Union. Currently the PG reps are not connected to the Union, which results in similar problems across several departments needing to be solved individually. I will solve this problem by simply coordinating with the PG reps, allowing an easier implementation of solutions.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">And more.</h2>
          <p class="lead">The points above are only the main points I want to implement next year. Other points include:
            <ul class="lead">
              <li>Access to past papers for every department</li>
              <li>Notebank, a supplementary to 'Blackboard', giving an easier access to notes and resources</li>
              <li>Support for international students by adding English subtitles to recordings</li>
              <li>Introduce module reps, allowing lecturers to delegate duties to students</li>
