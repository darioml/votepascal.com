          <p class="lead">I want to take elearning to the next level. Lectures are being recorded now, but the quality is low and only a few lectures participate. Many lecturers are reluctant of participating in recording, fearing a drop in participation or tedious setup requirements. This can be easily solved by conducting case studies and asking year reps to set up the recordings in advance of the lecture.</p>

          <p class="lead">The academic feedback needs to improve. Many students are still receiving inadequate feedback for their coursework and lecturers often dismiss year reps' opinions. I will change this by improving the communication between the student reps and staff, for example by expanding the current rep-staff conference. </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Post Graduate Representation. <span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Provide more social events for postgraduate students and integrate the representation system for PG within the Union, as the PG reps are not connected to the Union. This results that similar problems across different problems need to be solved indivdiaully instead of finding a universal solution. I will solve this problem by simply coordinating with the PG reps.</p>
