          <p class="lead">Hi there, I'm a third year Electrical and Electronic Engineering and I have previously been involved with the Union as a year rep. My effort was recognised with the John Lever Memorial Award for contributing significantly to teaching and learning achievements. I have also been web editor for RAG and I am currently EESoc's treasurer. And now I am ready to be your DPE.</p>
          <p class="lead">What do I do as the DPE? The DPE stands for 'Deputy President of Education' and as such I overview all the year and dep reps and attend meetings and conferences with the staff here at Imperial College, ensuring that the students get the best academic experience. Furthermore I want to implement the changes below.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">eLearning. <span class="text-muted">Have the classroom in your hands</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">I want to take elearning to the next level. Lectures are being recorded now, but the quality is low and only a few lectures participate. Many lecturers are reluctant of participating in recording, fearing a drop in participation or tedious setup requirements. This can be easily solved by conducting case studies and asking year reps to set up the recordings in advance of the lecture.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-8">
          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Feedback. <span class="text-muted">Listening to Opinions</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">The academic feedback needs to improve. Many students are still receiving inadequate feedback for their coursework and lecturers often dismiss year reps' opinions. I will change this by improving the communication between the student reps and staff, for example by expanding the current rep-staff conference. </p>

          <p class="lead">Provide more support for postgraduate students and integrate the representation system for PG within the Union. Currently the PG reps are not connected to the Union, which results that similar problems across different departments need to be solved indivdiaully instead of finding a universal solution. I will solve this problem by simply coordinating with the PG reps.</p>
